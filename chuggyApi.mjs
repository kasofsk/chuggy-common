/**
 * The pod's one way to reach this installation's own API: `sessionTransport`'s
 * bounded retry, against `task.api.url` instead of the worker plane, under the
 * same session bearer. THERE IS NO SECOND CREDENTIAL — the API resolves that
 * bearer to the session's principal and authorizes every call through the
 * project membership exactly as it authorizes a console user's, so a tool call
 * is a command the session's own membership admits and nothing more.
 *
 * A READ IS RETRIED AND A WRITE IS NOT, and a read is exactly `GET` and `HEAD`.
 * A retry is for a condition; a write that was answered is a decision, and
 * asking again would either duplicate it or hide the refusal from the model the
 * answer is for. A read is asked again on a thrown transport AND on a server
 * error, because both are conditions and neither is an answer the caller can
 * act on; a write gets one attempt and whatever came back. The writes this
 * client makes are each fenced by the API on something the caller had to
 * supply — a project sequence, a draft version, an idempotency key — so a
 * duplicate that did escape would be refused rather than applied twice.
 *
 * THE RETRY BOUND IS UNDER THE TOOL TIMEOUT ON PURPOSE. A tool call is cut off
 * at `chuggyToolTimeoutMs`; a client that spent longer than that retrying would
 * be one whose every failure reaches the model as a timeout with no status in
 * it, which is the one thing a relayed answer exists to prevent.
 *
 * A REDIRECT IS AN ANSWER. Following one would send the bearer to whatever the
 * `location` named, so the status is returned and the tool relays it.
