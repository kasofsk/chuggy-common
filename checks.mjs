/**
 * The check stage the worker runs itself: the command lines the plane resolved,
 * run in order in the repository workspace, and the verdict, report and
 * diagnostic they produce.
 *
 * THE WORKER RUNS THE LIST IT WAS HANDED. `Commands` mode carries the resolved
 * lines, so nothing here reads a configuration block, and a stage's lines can
 * gain another source without a second path into the worker.
 *
 * THE TASK'S KIND NEVER REACHES HERE. A work task's commands are its work and
 * their exit status is its verdict, exactly as an evaluation's are; what a
 * passing stage then leaves behind is the entrypoint's, and is the one place
 * the kind is read.
 *
 * THE SHELLS A STAGE'S BLOCK LAUNCHES INHERIT THE POD'S ENVIRONMENT, LESS THE
 * TASK DOCUMENT. The pod is placed with the whole document in a variable, and a
 * shell that read it would be reading the prose its own stage was authored
 * from; everything else the pod was given is what a gate expects to find, and
 * is passed on whole. The entrypoint takes the same environment from here for
 * the setup lines of the same block, which run in the same workspace moments
 * earlier: narrowing one shell and not the other leaves the document one `cp`
 * away from the commands.
 *
 * THE FIRST FAILURE STOPS THE STAGE, and a command killed by a signal is a
 * failure like any other. What follows a command that did not exit cleanly
 * cannot be trusted to mean anything, so the commands after it do not run and
 * are not reported as having passed.
 *
 * THE REPORT KEEPS THE STATUS AND NOT ONLY THE VERDICT, because a gate that
 * could not run and a gate that found something are both a failed stage and are
 * not the same fact.
 *
 * WHAT A COMMAND WRITES GOES TWO PLACES. It is streamed to the worker's own
 * stdout as it arrives, so a stage that dies mid-run leaves the pod log the
 * account it reached; and it is captured, bounded, for the diagnostic artifact
 * the plane keeps.
 *
 * THE CAPTURE IS BOUNDED AGAINST THE UPLOAD AND NOT AGAINST MEMORY. The
 * artifact the plane refuses is the one that turns a stage's Fail into a
 * crashed run, so the stage's whole room is taken from what one upload may
 * weigh, and one command's own cap only keeps a single chatty gate from
 * spending all of it.
