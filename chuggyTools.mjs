/**
 * The one `chuggy` MCP server a session pod serves in-process, and the capability
 * roster that decides which of its tools a session is given at all.
 *
 * TWO CHANNELS, TOLD APART BY WHAT THEY WRITE. A project tool is a command a
 * console user has: it goes over HTTP to the API under the pod's own session
 * bearer, the API resolves that bearer to the session's principal and authorizes
 * it through the project membership exactly as it authorizes a human's, and the
 * operation row records which session issued it. A decision tool
 * (`./leadDecision.mjs`) writes nothing at all.
 *
 * A ROSTER IS NOT A CONTROL. `allowedTools` and `disallowedTools` are enforced
 * by the agent runtime inside the pod, and the pod is the thing being
 * controlled. The two controls that are not the pod's are the membership,
 * enforced by the database when it authorizes a project access, and the
 * decision controls the selector applies to a finished turn — and the second is
 * post-hoc: the tool has already run and its command has already landed, and
 * what the selector refuses is the decision that used it. A control described as
 * stronger than it is, is worse than none.
 *
 * A READ ANSWERS ONE PAGE, WHOLE OR NOT AT ALL. Nothing here walks a
 * collection: the caller's page bound and cursor go through, the route's own
 * body comes back verbatim as JSON text, and the cursor is in the answer for
 * the model to ask again with. A tool that walked would spend the turn's whole
 * token budget on a project's history. A page too large to answer is refused
 * where the model can ask for a smaller one, never cut: a cut JSON document is
 * a page nothing can parse and nothing can resume from.
 *
 * THE TRANSCRIPT READS ARE THE ONE EXCEPTION, and `./transcriptPage.mjs` states
 * why: their route pages by store batch, a batch is bounded by the store's own
 * line bound, and one line is what a whole answer must fit inside. So no page
 * bound a caller could lower makes one of those pages answerable, and a refusal
 * there is a walk that cannot continue. They answer whole entries under the
 * bound and a cursor instead.
 *
 * AN ANSWER IS BOUNDED BY WHAT THE TRANSCRIPT HOLDS, and that is a much tighter
 * bound than the body drawn off the wire. Every answer becomes one `tool_result`
 * entry, `./sessionStore.mjs` mirrors an entry as one line it never splits, and
 * a line over `sessionStoreBatchBytesMax` is a body the plane refuses. The store
 * clips such a line rather than post it, and that is the bound of last resort:
 * the bound here stays because an answer the model can ask again for in pages is
 * a better answer than one the store cut to fit.
 *
 * THE ENTRY CARRIES THE ANSWER TWICE. The line is the on-disk transcript
 * format, and it holds the text in the message's `tool_result` block and again
 * in the entry's own `toolUseResult`. So the bound is what is left of the line
 * after the fixed envelope, divided by the copies — and an answer is weighed as
 * the entry escapes it rather than as it reads, because escaping is what the
 * line is charged for. The entry's shape is the runtime's and this image never
 * composes one, so the suite holds the bound against a captured entry.
 *
 * A WRITE RELAYS THE API'S OUTCOME UNALTERED — the status and the error body, as
 * text. No retry, no repair, no hiding a 409. A tool that decided what a refusal
 * meant would be deciding something the API decided.
 *
 * DERIVED WORK ONLY IS WHAT `DraftAuthor` ADMITS. `file_dependent` files
 * against a parent that already exists and carries it in the draft's
 * dependencies; a roster holding `DraftAuthor` alone cannot originate work.
 * Origination is `create_draft` under `DraftOriginate` alone. Which capability
 * a session is opened with is the provisioning root's, not this image's, so
 * what is true here is the mapping: a roster without `DraftOriginate` cannot
 * reach the tool, and the derived-work rule is that mapping rather than a
 * sentence in a description.
 * `Prerequisite` is admitted by the schema only so its refusal can name the
 * reason — a released ticket's dependencies are immutable in
 * `model/domain.qnt`, which names re-authoring machinery as deliberately absent.
 *
 * `zod` IS A PEER DEPENDENCY OF THE AGENT SDK, NOT ONE OF ITS DEPENDENCIES, so
 * the shapes are functions of a `z` the caller resolves rather than of an import
 * here, and the image's build probes are what prove the peer is installed and is
 * the one the contract parses with.
