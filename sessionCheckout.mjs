/**
 * The repository a session pod reads, cloned once before its runtime opens so
 * the SDK's `cwd` is a working tree and `settingSources: ["project"]` has a
 * `CLAUDE.md` to load.
 *
 * IT IS THE DEFAULT-BRANCH HEAD AND IT IS NOT PINNED. A work attempt clones
 * `--no-checkout` and detaches onto the `TargetCommit` its decision froze
 * (`./entrypoint.mjs`); a session has no ticket, so it has no decision and no
 * commit to freeze. A standing reader wants the tree as it is rather than as it
 * was, so the clone takes the remote's own default branch and a new pod is a
 * new read of the tree. The commit it landed on is logged, because a lead that
 * reasons about the tree leaves a record of which tree it was.
 *
 * THE SITE'S MAP AND ITS GRANT CHECK ARE THE WORKER'S, REUSED RATHER THAN
 * COPIED. `workerRepository()` resolves the reference against
 * `CHUG_WORKER_REPOSITORIES`, refuses a repository with no URL, credential or
 * username, and builds the `GIT_ASKPASS` environment; the grant check beside it
 * is `./entrypoint.mjs`'s own. A second resolver would be a second set of rules
 * for the same site data.
 *
 * A MISCONFIGURED SITE IS REFUSED AND A FAILED CLONE IS NOT. A reference the
 * map does not carry, or a credential the attempt's authority does not grant,
 * is a launcher that placed a pod it never gave a tree to, and the pod is the
 * only witness to it: the site's map is the image's device and the scheduler
 * passes it through unread. So it comes back as a refusal carrying its reason,
 * which `./session.mjs` fails the placed turn with — a raise here left the
 * reason on stderr and the attempt row carrying the label a pod that never
 * started carries. A clone that reached git and did not finish is the other
 * case — the network, the remote, the disk — and it returns nothing: a lead
 * that cannot read the tree can still read the project through the API and
 * decide, and refusing to start would trade a degraded lead for none.
 *
 * THE REFERENCE IS WHAT THE PLACEMENT SAID AND IS NOT ALWAYS THE BINDING. A
 * site that mirrors its projects in-cluster names the mirror for the binding in
 * `CHUG_SCHEDULER_SESSION_POLICY`, and the scheduler resolves it before the
 * placement; whichever URL arrives is resolved here against the same map, under
 * the same rules, with its own credential.
 *
 * NOTHING WRITES TO THE CHECKOUT, AND THAT IS A POD-SIDE CONTROL. The lead's
 * roster does not carry `RepositoryWrite`, so `./chuggyTools.mjs` puts `Write`,
 * `Edit` and `NotebookEdit` in `disallowedTools` — which the runtime inside the
 * pod is what reads. The filesystem grants the pod write on its own workspace,
 * so this is a roster the controlled thing enforces and not a permission; the
 * ceiling that is not the pod's is the session's membership at the API.
