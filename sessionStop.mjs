/**
 * The stop a member puts on the turn a thread's session is answering: the
 * plane is asked whether the turn was stopped for as long as the turn runs,
 * and the runtime is interrupted once it says so.
 *
 * THE PLANE HOLDS THE QUESTION, so a stop is heard when the plane next looks
 * and not when this next asks. A question answered with nothing is asked again
 * no sooner than the mailbox's own pause after it began: a hold the plane
 * spent is followed at once, and a plane holding nothing is asked no more
 * often than an empty mailbox is.
 *
 * A TURN THAT IS BEING WRITTEN HEARS SOONER. The plane answers a live post of
 * a stopped turn with the turn, and `./sessionLive.mjs` hands that to `told`,
 * which is the plane's same answer by another road: whichever of the two
 * arrives first interrupts, and the other finds it done.
 *
 * A STOP INTERRUPTS THE TURN IT NAMES AND NO OTHER. The session lets go of a
 * turn when it reads the turn's result, which abandons the question in
 * flight, and an answer read after that interrupts nothing: the turn after
 * cannot be the one interrupted.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SETTLES THE TURN OR ENDS THE SESSION. An interrupted turn ends
 * with the runtime's own result and is settled as that result says, which the
 * plane takes and keeps nothing of; `stopped` is how the session knows the
 * result it read is such a turn's. A plane that could not be asked is asked
 * again. So is one that was answered for with a condition that passes, by
 * whatever stands between a runner and a plane it reaches on a public host.
 * Any other answer is the plane's decision, so this session asks it nothing
 * more.
