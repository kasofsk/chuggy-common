/**
 * The session's mailbox: the long-poll claim against the worker plane, and the
 * async iterable of user messages it feeds one `query()`.
 *
 * ONE TURN IS IN FLIGHT AT A TIME, and the generator is what enforces it. After
 * yielding a turn it blocks until the pod says that turn settled, so the runtime
 * cannot be handed a second turn while the first is still being answered — and
 * so nothing belonging to a later turn can arrive while the pod is draining the
 * current one's messages.
 *
 * BOTH LOOPS ARE BOUNDED. One request is bounded by the plane's own long poll,
 * and the loop as a whole by the idle bound the pod was launched with: a
 * mailbox that stays empty that long ends the iterable, the query ends with it,
 * and the process exits for the scheduler's idle reaper to collect.
 *
 * A CLAIM IS ANNOUNCED BEFORE THE TURN IS YIELDED, which is what lets the pod
 * reset anything a turn owns — its decision staging — with no way for one turn's
 * state to be read by the next.
 *
 * THE IDLE WINDOW OPENS ON THE FIRST EMPTY POLL, NOT WHEN THE POD STARTED. A
 * cold session pages a resumed store and spawns a runtime before this loop is
 * asked for anything, and a startup slower than the bound would then end the
 * iterable on its first look at an empty mailbox. Idle is time the session spent
 * with nothing to do, so it is measured from the first moment it had nothing to
 * do, and a claim closes the window again.
