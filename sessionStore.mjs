/**
 * The agent runtime's `SessionStore`, written against the worker plane instead
 * of a local file. The capability roster the same session runs under is
 * `./chuggyTools.mjs`, beside the tools it admits.
 *
 * `query()` calls exactly three of the interface's six methods — `append` on
 * every run, `load` and `listSubkeys` on every resume — so those three are what
 * this implements and the other three raise. A silent no-op there would be a
 * console read or a retention sweep that quietly returned nothing.
 *
 * THE STREAM IS THE RUNTIME'S SESSION ID, AND `key.projectKey` IS DISCARDED. It
 * is the sanitised `cwd` with no option that sets it, so a path derived from it
 * would be a second and weaker authority for the tenant, project and session the
 * bearer already names.
 *
 * BATCHES ARE FROZEN WHEN THEY ARE NUMBERED. Once entries are given a number the
 * bytes never change: a batch the plane did not acknowledge is re-sent under the
 * same number with the same body, which is what lets the plane deduplicate by
 * digest without ever reading a payload. Nothing is merged into an
 * unacknowledged batch, because that would change the digest and the plane would
 * be right to call it a conflict.
 *
 * A LINE LONGER THAN A BATCH IS CLIPPED HERE RATHER THAN POSTED. Nothing splits
 * a line, so an entry over the bound could only go as a body the plane refuses,
 * and a refusal there fails the turn `StoreRefused` and stops the session. The
 * producer is not where that can be held: a built-in tool's result never crosses
 * `./chuggyTools.mjs`, and the caps the runtime does offer count characters
 * where the line is charged escaped bytes, which one character can cost several
 * of. So the store is the bound of last resort. It replaces every value a clip
 * can shorten with a note naming what the original weighed, keeping a head of it
 * where a head of it is worth anything, and shares what a batch leaves evenly
 * between them, a value that fits inside its share going back whole. What a
 * value is decides which of those it gets, and the answers are below. What
 * resumes over the entry parses it and reads that it is seeing
 * less, so it can run the tool again. The pod's own file is untouched; this is
 * what the store posts, not what happened. Only an entry no clip brings under the
 * bound raises, naming what it weighs and whether a clip reached it.
 *
 * WHAT NAMES THE ENTRY IS NOT BULK, HOWEVER MUCH IT WEIGHS. Weight is what finds
 * a result — a producer this tree has never seen writes one under whatever field
 * it likes, and asking which tool ran would cover only the tools already known.
 * But weight cannot tell a result from the entry's own name for itself: an
 * entry's identity, the session it reopens as and the directory it reopens in are
 * strings like any other, and a working directory deep enough to outweigh the
 * note that would replace it would be taken by weight alone. A resume handed a
 * path the runtime never wrote is a resume in the wrong place, so those keys are
 * passed over by name — `entryIdentityKeys`, and only at the two levels where
 * they mean the entry rather than a result. Deeper than that the same words are
 * the result's own: a `type` inside a `tool_result` block says what the block is,
 * and a `content` inside `toolUseResult` is exactly the bulk a clip is for. The
 * few names that mean the same thing at every depth — what a block is, which
 * call it answers, what a tool was called, the path it reports, whether it
 * failed, the signature over it — are `resultIdentityKeys` and are passed over
 * wherever they sit.
 *
 * A CLIP SHORTENS ONLY WHAT DEGRADES GRACEFULLY, AND WHAT DOES NOT DEGRADES SOME
 * OTHER WAY. A head of a result is a smaller result: less is read, the note says
 * so, and the tool can be run again. That is what makes clipping better than
 * stopping, and it is not true of everything heavy, so a value is taken by how it
 * survives being made smaller, and these are the answers:
 *
 *   - TEXT IS CUT TO A HEAD, which is the ordinary case above.
 *   - A LIST OF STRINGS GOES WHOLE OR NOT AT ALL. A head of prose is prose; the
 *     first few elements of a list are a different list, and nothing in one says
 *     which kind it is. The elements of a JSON-Schema `enum` are the values a
 *     field may take, so a prefix of them plus a note is a shorter set of legal
 *     values with an illegal one added, and it reads as complete. So a list is
 *     either put back whole, where its share reaches, or replaced by a list whose
 *     one element is the note. The note is still an element, which is as close to
 *     saying nothing as a value that has to stay a list of strings can get.
 *   - AN ENCODED VALUE IS DROPPED WHOLE. Base64 is worth exactly what it decodes
 *     to: a head of it decodes to nothing, and the note appended to it is not
 *     even in the alphabet. So `encodedString` is never cut.
 *   - A MEDIA BLOCK IS DROPPED WHOLE, whatever its source is. An image or a
 *     document block is the source it names, so it is replaced by a `text` block
 *     saying what was dropped and how much of it: the content array is still one
 *     the API accepts and whatever resumes reads what it is missing. Dropping
 *     rather than raising is deliberate — reading a large image is an ordinary
 *     thing for a session to do, and a session that stops every time it does one
 *     is the defect this module exists to fix.
 *   - A SIGNED BLOCK IS ATOMIC. A thinking block is signed over its exact text
 *     and the runtime replays both to resume an assistant turn, so a head of
 *     either is not a smaller thinking block but one the API refuses — later,
 *     somewhere else, off a line already written. It cannot be dropped either:
 *     nothing stands in for it. So `signedBlock` is not descended into, and an
 *     entry no clip can bring under the bound without it raises here at the
 *     write, which is the loud failure and the early one.
 *   - IDENTITY IS PASSED OVER BY NAME, which is the section above.
 *
 * SHARING IS WHY EVERY COPY IS CUT rather than only as many as it takes to fit:
 * the runtime writes one result several times over, a resume reads one of those
 * copies and never the others, and a clip that stopped at the first fit would
 * leave a copy nothing reads whole and starve the copy that is read to pay for
 * it.
 *
 * DEDUPLICATION IS PER STREAM AND AN ENTRY WITHOUT A UUID IS NEVER DROPPED. A
 * fork re-appends the parent's entries under the fork's own key carrying the
 * parent's uuids, so an index wider than one stream would discard most of every
 * inquiry; and the runtime writes bookkeeping entries that carry no uuid at all.
 * The remembered set is bounded, so a re-appended ancient uuid is written twice
 * rather than dropped — a duplicate the `parentUuid` chain walks past, where a
 * dropped entry is a hole nothing can walk past.
 *
 * AN INQUIRY'S OWN TRANSCRIPT IS NEVER WRITTEN. A fork is answered aside and
 * thrown away, so its adapter is opened with `retain: false`: `append` resolves
 * having sent nothing, and the turn therefore names no batch range, because
 * nothing numbered a batch to name. `load` and `listSubkeys` are untouched by
 * the mode — they still go to the plane, which is how the fork reads the parent
 * it was forked from, and "ephemeral" must not come to mean "disconnected".
 * This discard is not the control: the pod is the thing being controlled, and
 * the database refuses an inquiry's batch on its own.
