// The harness's boundary: what a module at this repository's root may import.
//
// Every module here, its suites and fixtures included, runs in an image that
// holds this repository's shipped set and whatever that image installs
// globally, and nothing else of this checkout. The suites run there too. So
// a module here reaches Node's own modules, its neighbours at the root, and
// the packages an image installs, by name.
//
// Every rule below is proved to bite against a fixture tree carrying its
// violation, in `.chug/tasks/check-boundaries.test.sh`. A boundary rule that
// has never rejected anything is an unverified control.
