/**
 * The pod's Session mode: load the session from the store, open one `query()`
 * over streaming input, long-poll the mailbox for turns, run each and post what
 * came back. A work attempt is still one-shot and nothing here changes that.
 *
 * THE RESULT MESSAGE IS NOT THE END OF THE TURN'S EVIDENCE. The runtime reports
 * a batch it gave up on as a `mirror_error`, and one can arrive after the
 * `result` that said success — a loop that breaks on `result` never sees it. So
 * the pod records the result, keeps reading for the drain bound, and only then
 * decides. A `mirror_error` seen at any point fails the turn with
 * `StoreRefused` and stops the session: the transcript now has a hole, and a
 * session that keeps talking over a hole is one whose next resume is quietly
 * wrong.
 *
 * `persistSession` IS LEFT UNSET, because the runtime forbids `false` beside a
 * store — local writes are what the mirror fires after. The subprocess gets a
 * writable config directory on the pod's ephemeral workspace instead, and on a
 * store-resumed run that copy is materialised to a temporary directory that
 * does not outlive the process. The store is the only durable copy either way.
 *
 * `sessionStoreFlush` IS EAGER, because under the batched default nothing
 * reaches the store until the turn ends and the console's per-message
 * granularity would be a blank page for the whole turn.
 *
 * WHAT A TURN SPENT IS READ OFF THE RUNTIME'S OWN MESSAGES, NEVER OFF THE
 * RESULT TEXT. The controls the selector runs over a decision check the model,
 * the tools, the tokens and the duration it took; a count taken from the
 * answer's prose would be a count the thing being controlled wrote. So the pod
 * is the measuring host, and a turn the runtime accounted for nothing on
 * carries no measurement at all rather than one of zeroes — the reader of the
 * envelope is what refuses a decision with no provenance.
 *
 * AN INQUIRY FORKS THE PARENT OR IT DOES NOT RUN. What it resumes is
 * `forkFrom`, the lead's own runtime reference, and never its own: its own
 * store is never written, so resuming it would load nothing. An inquiry the
 * plane named no `forkFrom` for therefore fails its turn instead of opening a
 * query — a fresh session under the lead's objectives answers confidently out
 * of nothing, and the member reading the answer cannot tell that from the
 * lead's own thinking.
 *
 * AN INQUIRY IS ONE EXCHANGE, AND THE POD ENDS ITS MAILBOX AFTER IT. Leaving
 * the loop is not enough: the mailbox's generator is still driven by the live
 * query, so it would claim a second turn and abandon it claimed. The door is
 * what bounds an inquiry — nothing enqueues a second turn on one — so this is
 * the weaker of the two walls, and it is here because the pod is what would
 * otherwise spend the account's attempt on a turn the member never asked for.
