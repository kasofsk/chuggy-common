/**
 * The session pod's one way to reach the worker plane: `workerRequest`'s bounded
 * retry, against the same base URL, with the same headers and under the session
 * bearer.
 *
 * A RETRY IS FOR A CONDITION, NEVER FOR A DECISION. The session routes answer
 * `stop` and `retry` as distinct things — a fenced attempt is `401`, a batch
 * that changed under its own number is `409`, an exhausted store is `413` — and
 * asking any of those again gets the same answer fifteen times before the caller
 * is told anything. So a thrown fetch and a server error are retried and every
 * other status is returned for the caller to read.
 *
 * THE FIFTH ARGUMENT IS THE SAME BAG `workerRequest` TAKES. A caller reaching
 * the plane through whichever of the two its mode was given cannot name the
 * module, so naming one field here must not unset the others: each is
 * destructured with its own default. `settled` names statuses that are answers
 * rather than conditions, which for everything below the server range this
 * already returns, so it only ever adds to what a caller reads back.
