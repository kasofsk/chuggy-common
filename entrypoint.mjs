/**
 * What one work attempt is given, what runs it, and what it leaves behind.
 *
 * THE CARRIER IS THE MODE AND THE CANDIDATE IS THE TASK KIND. Whether an agent
 * or a list of commands runs the attempt is the worker mode the task carries;
 * whether what ran leaves a branch behind is the task's kind and its verdict.
 * Neither is read from the other, so a Work task carrying commands runs them
 * with no agent and still pushes the candidate a passing run leaves.
 *
 * THE COMMANDS' EXIT STATUS IS THE WORK'S SUCCESS. Where an agent ran the
 * attempt there is an account of the run to take a verdict from; where commands
 * ran it there is nothing but what they exited with, and nothing else is asked
 * for.
 *
 * AN EMPTY DIFF IS STILL A CANDIDATE IN THIS WORKER'S WORK MODE, because the
 * commit it makes is `--allow-empty`: an attempt whose commands changed nothing
 * declares the commit anyway. That is this worker's rule and not a property of
 * the platform, so a configuration read across to another runner cannot assume
 * it; a repository that wants an empty attempt to fail says so in a command.
 *
 * A POOL HANDS ITS POD AN ENVELOPE, AND THE TASK IS FETCHED. Where a launcher
 * writes the task document itself, a pool writes only the plane to fetch it
 * from, the bearer to fetch it under, and what the pool itself mounted. What
 * the plane answers is the document less that plane, so the plane is joined
 * back on and the attempt runs from admission onwards exactly as a pushed one.
