/**
 * The PostgreSQL one attempt runs its gates against: a server of the pod's

 *
 * A repository's gates migrate the server they are pointed at, and a migration
 * makes cluster-wide roles and hands objects to them: an authority over the
 * whole server, which agent-authored code can hold only on a server that holds
 * nothing else. This one is reached on the pod's loopback alone and ends with
 * the pod. It is already answering when this runs — the pod starts this
 * container only after the sidecar's startup probe has seen it accept a
 * connection — so what is handed to the gates is the URL as given, under the
 * gates' own name.
