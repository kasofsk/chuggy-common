/**
 * The job plane as a pool reaches it, for one thing: ending the attempt of a

 * own bearer, as a crashed harness ends its own. The attempt then ends when
 * its workload did rather than when its lease runs out.
 *
 * Each call is made once and nothing here retries it, because an attempt the
 * plane did not hear about is still ended by its lease. One that already
 * reported is no longer live, so the plane refuses this and the report stands.
