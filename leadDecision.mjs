/**
 * The decision tools, which write nothing. They stage into a buffer the turn
 * owns, and the buffer becomes the turn's answer — the same document the
 * selector runtime's own parser already reads, so the runtime remains the single
 * writer of a dispatch and of the refusal ledger, still under its own fence.
 *
 * COMPOSING THE DOCUMENT IS WHY THEY EXIST. The pod cuts a long answer before it
 * posts it, and a truncated JSON document is exactly what a lenient parser would
 * half-accept; a document composed from typed calls is well-formed by
 * construction, and a staging that would outgrow the mailbox row is refused
 * where the lead can still see the refusal rather than at settling time.
 *
 * THE DOCUMENT'S BOUND IS THE ONLY SIZE BOUND, and it is the tighter one by
 * construction: `selectorHandoffNoteBytesMax` weighs one field and
 * `leadDecisionBytesMax` weighs that field inside the whole document, so a note
 * its own column would refuse has already been refused here. A second check
 * against the wider bound could never fire, and a control that cannot fire is
 * worse than none. `leadDecision.test.mjs` asserts the ordering that makes this
 * true, so a future bound that inverted it would be caught rather than assumed.
 *
 * A BOUND REFUSED IS AN ERROR THE MODEL SEES. A lead that believes it refused
 * two tickets and refused one is a lead whose record is wrong, so nothing here
 * drops a call silently: past a bound, outside the observed view, or naming one
 * ticket twice, the call raises and the model reads the reason.
 *
 * THE BUFFER IS KEYED ON THE TURN. `reset` is called as a turn is claimed, so
 * one turn's staging cannot leak into the next; a suite drives two turns and
 * asserts the second carries nothing of the first.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT SET IS NOT INVENTED. A turn that stages a choice and says nothing
 * about the handoff note keeps the note it was shown, because the note is a
 * successor's only context and a decision that silently cleared it would be a
 * lead erasing its own memory.
 *
 * ATTENTION IS THE SAME, AND HARDER, BECAUSE THE OBSERVATION DOES NOT CARRY IT.
 * The runtime writes a decision's attention onto the project, so a turn that
 * refuses one ticket and says nothing would move a project from `Attention` to
 * `Monitoring` — a lead quietly clearing the flag a human is watching. So the
 * standing value outlives the turn: it is seeded from the most recent seeded
 * decision where the observation carries one, moved only by `set_attention`,
 * and carried across every turn this pod takes. `Monitoring` is used only where
 * this pod has never been told an attention at all, which is a resumed session
 * whose observation carried no seeding — the residual, and the reason to put
 * the standing attention in the observation document itself.
