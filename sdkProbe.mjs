/**
 * The build's verdict on what the session mode can resolve, read off the image
 * rather than off the Dockerfile.
 *
 * `zod` IS A PEER OF THE AGENT SDK THAT THE POD'S OWN SCRIPTS IMPORT TOO. npm's
 * global install nests a package's peers inside that package's own tree, where
 * the scripts' resolution never looks, and nothing about a missing `zod` is
 * visible until a lead takes a turn: the tool shapes are zod raw shapes, so a
 * pod without it starts, claims a turn and then fails every one of them. So the
 * image installs `zod` beside the SDK at a pinned version, where npm places the
 * one copy both resolve, and this checks the two agree.
 *
 * THE AGREEMENT IS READ, NOT ASSERTED. The SDK's own `peerDependencies.zod`
 * range is read off the installed package and the installed `zod` is checked
 * against it, which is the device the two Claude Code pins already use: a bump
 * of `AGENT_SDK_VERSION` that moved the range fails the build instead of the
 * rig.
 *
 * THE OTHER TWO PEERS ARE LEFT WHERE npm NESTS THEM. `@anthropic-ai/sdk` and
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` are declared peers too, and nothing but the SDK
 * imports either, so the copies inside its tree are the ones that matter;
 * `toolProbe.mjs` stands the in-process MCP server up and lists all of its
 * tools. A peer the SDK needs and cannot resolve shows up as a probe that
 * fails, which is the point of running both here.
 *
 * RESOLUTION IS THE RUNTIME'S OWN. This runs from the directory the pod's
 * scripts live in and imports through the same specifiers `session.mjs` does,
 * because `NODE_PATH` is honoured by `require` and ignored by `import`, and
 * what actually finds a package is the `node_modules` walk up from here.
