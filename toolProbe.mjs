/**
 * The build's verdict on the chuggy server: that the runtime can list every tool
 * each roster admits, read off the built server rather than off the source.
 *
 * WHY A BUILD PROBE AND NOT A SUITE. The failure it catches is invisible from
 * inside this repo, which does not carry the agent runtime: a tool shape the
 * runtime's own JSON-schema converter cannot render makes the WHOLE listing
 * throw. The server still reports itself connected, `mcpServers` still names it,
 * and the model is simply told those tools do not exist — a lead that reads
 * nothing and decides nothing, with no error anywhere. It was a `z.record` that
 * did it the first time.
 *
 * IT RESOLVES THE RUNTIME THE WAY THE POD DOES, through `sessionSdk`, so what
 * is proved is the resolution a turn will make and not a second one written
 * beside it. That is what turns a missing peer dependency into a build failure.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASKS IS IN `./toolListing.mjs`, so that the asking is itself tested:
 * this file resolves the runtime and names the rosters, and nothing more.
