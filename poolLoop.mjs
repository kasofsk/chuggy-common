/**
 * The pool loop: each pass takes a token, reads what the backend holds, ends
 * the attempts of workloads that ended without reporting, polls the plane for
 * the room left, stops what it is told to and places what it is offered.
 * chuggy's `src/interpreter/workerPoolClient.ts` is the same loop in
 * TypeScript, and a change to one is a change to both.
 *
 * A JOB AND A SESSION ARE COUNTED APART. Each kind has its own ceiling, its
 * own room on the poll and its own offers, so a session never takes a job's
 * room nor a job a session's, and a pool that names no session ceiling asks
 * for none. Each kind's end is reported to its own plane.
 *
 * Nothing is held between passes. What is running is read from the backend,
 * so a restarted loop reconciles the work its predecessor placed, and a
 * settlement is never retried because the next poll's `held` renews the lease.
 * A denial ends the run; an outage backs off and comes back.
